# Team Profile 
Hi my name is Andrew Chen, my student number is S3599919 and I am a manager at  Simple Tech. I was born and raised in Australia, specifically in Carlton. My nationality is Chinese and I can speak both Cantonese and Mandarin. I really love learning about computers and specifically on how to assemble and troubleshoot, my hobbies include gaming on the PC and playing basketball with my friends. My interests in I.T include learning how to build computers and learning more in depth about troubleshooting, I do not have much I.T experience outside of home, as I am more of a self-taught learner, hence majority of the things I learn are from the Internet or from PC Magazines. 

# Group Processes: 
I had experienced quite a lot of issues in with my group, hence with this assignment and with permission, I will be working on it indivudally. The changes that will be implemented will be based purely on my ideas and concepts. Therefore it is safe to say that my experience whilst working with my old group was not a pleasant one. 

# Career Plans: 
Although there are no common elements, we each strive to continue our future jobs in the technological side of things, sticking true to our Information Technology roots. My ideal job was to become an IT Technical Support Officer, which focused on helping clients/customers who are in need of help regarding any I.T related inquiries, whilst the other members ideal jobs were becoming a Software Engineer and becoming a Games Developer.
