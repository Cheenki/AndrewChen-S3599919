# Team Name: 

Simple Tech

# Personal Information 

Hi my name is Andrew Chen, my student number is S3599919 and I am a manager at  Simple Tech. I was born and raised in Australia, specifically in Carlton. My nationality is Chinese and I can speak both Cantonese and Mandarin. I really love learning about computers and specifically on how to assemble and troubleshoot, my hobbies include gaming on the PC and playing basketball with my friends. My interests in I.T include learning how to build computers and learning more in depth about troubleshooting, I do not have much I.T experience outside of home, as I am more of a self-taught learner, hence majority of the things I learn are from the Internet or from PC Magazines. 

# Group Processes: 

I had experienced quite a lot of issues in with my group, hence with this assignment and with permission, I will be working on it indivudally. The changes that will be implemented will be based purely on my ideas and concepts. Therefore it is safe to say that my experience whilst working with my old group was not a pleasant one. 

# Career Plans: 

Although there are no common elements, we each strive to continue our future jobs in the technological side of things, sticking true to our Information Technology roots. My ideal job was to become an IT Technical Support Officer, which focused on helping clients/customers who are in need of help regarding any I.T related inquiries, whilst the other members ideal jobs were becoming a Software Engineer and becoming a Games Developer.

# Project Description: 

## Overview  

**Topic** 

My project idea consists of generating a language application that is for primary/secondary or even tertiary students in hopes to engage them into improving their English or learning another language in an easy and effective way; this is via utilising an application called “Android Studios” alongside other programs such as Java. The name of this application will be called “EZ English” or “EZ-E” for short and is designed for Android-based phones/tablets and will be accessible on the Google Play Store and eventually the Apple play store aswell. 

**Motivation**

Mobile Learning is a prime example of language development whilst learning at a speedy but fun rate. Our world today is obsessed with technology and what would be better than being able to self-study on devices that we use on the daily. We know that the majority of the students are opting to study online due to their time restrictions, with this application students can study anywhere and, on the go, as well. M-learning is becoming the future and with endless amounts of learning resources available in a compact style, students would enjoy such a platform for the expansion of their vocabulary.  

**Landscape** 

There are some similar systems such as the one mentioned above which is called the

**Scopes and Limits** 

**Tools and Technologies** 

Tools or technologies needed to create such a service will be being able to utilise “Android Studio” as it is Google’s officially supported IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for Android applications. Using its emulator and creating a blank template for our service, we will be using “Java” as our source of inputting codes and resource files to generate the output that we will be needing, more specifically ensuring that we have JDK 8 (Java SE Development Kit 8) installed on our PC. This program can be accessed on a relatively fast computer that has high RAM to ensure that our memory is not constrained whilst we are working with our application.

Knowing how to understand Java as it underpins all Android development, understanding of Android SDK (Software Development Kit) and knowing how to use Android Studios will be the main skills required to build such an application. Most of this can be done directly from the computer, and the learning process is not difficult, hence you do not need a lot of knowledge to make a basic application. 

**Testing** 

If the project is deemed to be successful upon launch, then m-learning will slowly be incorporated into our daily lives as students and hopefully, in the future, many individuals will find learning a language much simpler and more enjoyable as well. Out with the old and in with the new, we are taking advantage or our current technology to its fullest potential, whilst keeping students of many ages happy and entertained.
