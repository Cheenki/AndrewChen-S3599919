![photo of me](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42104341/43755833-4c097d44-9a55-11e8-9b84-e4a318156853.jpg)

# Team Name: 

Simple Tech (Making Technology Simple and Easy) 

# Personal Information 

Hi my name is Andrew Chen, my student number is S3599919 and I am a manager at  Simple Tech. I was born and raised in Australia, specifically in Carlton. My nationality is Chinese and I can speak both Cantonese and Mandarin. I really love learning about computers and specifically on how to assemble and troubleshoot, my hobbies include gaming on the PC and playing basketball with my friends. My interests in I.T include learning how to build computers and learning more in depth about troubleshooting, I do not have much I.T experience outside of home, as I am more of a self-taught learner, hence majority of the things I learn are from the Internet or from PC Magazines. 

# Group Processes: 

I had experienced quite a lot of issues in with my group, hence with this assignment and with permission, I will be working on it indivudally. The changes that will be implemented will be based purely on my ideas and concepts. Therefore it is safe to say that my experience whilst working with my old group was not a pleasant one. 

# Career Plans: 

Although there are no common elements, we each strive to continue our future jobs in the technological side of things, sticking true to our Information Technology roots. My ideal job was to become an IT Technical Support Officer, which focused on helping clients/customers who are in need of help regarding any I.T related inquiries, whilst the other members ideal jobs were becoming a Software Engineer and becoming a Games Developer.

Being a technical support officer allows me to do what I like to do best, which is to help others that are in need, I feel a sense of satisfaction knowing that I had helped someone overcome a situation that they may have been stuck in. Hence this job is what I would like to steer towards to and hopefully be able to become in the near future.

# Project Description: 

## Overview  

**Topic** 

My project idea consists of generating a language application that is for primary/secondary or even tertiary students in hopes to engage them into improving their English or learning another language in an easy and effective way; this is achieved via utilising an application called “Android Studios” alongside other programs such as Java. The name of this application will be called “EZ English” or “EZ-E” for short and is designed for Android-based phones/tablets and will be accessible on the Google Play Store and eventually the Apple play store aswell. The reason for chosing this topic is because it will always become a necessity to integrate into our everyday life especially at primary/secondary schools where learning is very important and rather essential for every individual. 

Being able to translate and learn english based on a hand held device is a very effective and efficient way of teaching students and ensuring that their learning processes are more fun rather than boring, this is due to the inbuilt features of the application where the individual will have endless possibilities to learn languages in a very fun way. In regards to the big picture, the project will eventually expand and be successfully programmed to be able to use on both Android and Apple platforms so that it isn't just one operating system specific, and the outcome from all of this would hopefully be that people will seek to engage in learning a new language whether it may be to boost their current language or to learn an entirely new one, utilising the application will undoubtedly open up the eyes of many. 

**Motivation**

Mobile Learning is a prime example of language development whilst learning at a speedy but fun rate. Our world today is obsessed with technology and what would be better than being able to self-study on devices that we use on the daily. We know that the majority of the students are opting to study online due to their time restrictions, with this application students can study anywhere and, on the go, as well. M-learning is becoming the future and with endless amounts of learning resources available in a compact style, students would enjoy such a platform for the expansion of their vocabulary. Alongside the current trends of 2018, User-friendly applications are one of the most trending tools that allow and ensure that in the near future fewer people will need to learn how various technologies really work. Hence to the future employer, allowing them to see that I am working on a project that is beneficial to the future will enable them to seek that I am not thinking of the current moment but wanting to future proof the project and continue to progress and add more towards it in the future.

**Landscape** 

Duolingo is one of the biggest competitors in terms of the field that we are wanting to do our project idea on, they have quite the similar concept of learning languages and having diffrent departments of difficulty levels and such, but they do not have a system where they reward members who continue to stick with learning a language. What they do not have that EZ-E will be a dictionary definintion of every word during the learning process and there will also be a feature where the user can use his finger and draw the character of a language for example; a chinese, japanese or korean character, making this a more interactive application compared to some other ones. Also all EZ-E lessons will be avaliable offline after a one time download, and will only ever continue to update over the Wi-Fi when connected or 4G if outdoors, Duolingo has a Duolingo Plus feature which is a paid feature that enables offline access and gets rid of advertisements, EZ-E will have very minor advertisements but only just before the lesson starts as a form of earning a small revenue for the company.

# Detailed Description: 
**Aims** 

The aim of this project is to be able to successfully implement the software onto the hand-held devices of students at primary/secondary and tertiary college to help them learn languages faster. To set a more specific aim which is rather relevant to the future would be to be able to integrate this software into possibly a; hand-held on the spot translation device or an in-ear translation device. The goal is to be able to create a device called the EZ-E Block and software/program once the implementation of the software into the educational aspect has been covered. Therefore, the aim is to produce a translation device that is useful for people who travel, going from a broader idea to a more precise one. 

If things do not go to plan, if we are not able to reach the stage where we can begin working on devices that have an additional software for on the spot translation whilst being offline and not having internet connectivity, then we will continue to work on the educational aspect of it. For our project, students come first and then travellers, but if we do have enough resources then we will be able to continue with both aspects. Students will always be a focus and priority because education is key to learning new things, technology is only advancing more and more each day, students are reverting to laptops and iPads rather than textbooks because it’s more convenient, hence being able to focus on the current generation and how they are now will undoubtedly make this project rather successful. 


This is an example of what the product may look like once it is released: 

<img width="500" alt="what it might look like" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42104341/47254038-b371b280-d4a7-11e8-9f57-25e3f2c8b1a4.png">


**Plans and Progress** 

The story of how I had wanted to develop this software began was when I first came into Australia from China, I had arrived at a very young age and hence my English has improved dramatically throughout the years that I have been attending school. I never really thought of generating a type of software or even creating a new device, my interests in technology gradually got the best of me and I wanted to try something new and creative that could benefit not just myself, but every other person who may be going through the same path that I did when I first came to Australia and not knowing any English. Long story short, I wanted to make things easier for people of any age to learn a new language with a simple click of a button, or with a user-friendly application that could be easily integrated into our phones and other hand-held devices, whether it may be at home or at school, it can be easily accessed anywhere around the world. 

Growing up I had learnt that Mobile learning had become more and more integrated into our lives, we are moving away from books and having more interactive based activities at school, I guess this is the direction that majority of the schools are taking as it is what human beings are used to nowadays. We do almost everything online and rarely anything on the books anymore which is rather sad, but this is how we evolve and prepare ourselves for the future. Our world today is obsessed with technology, so I thought why not make it easier for students to self-study on devices that we use on a daily by creating an application that can be used offline and online to enable them to study at a faster and more effective rate that could benefit them and other people for their classes and themselves. 

Coming from primary, secondary and now tertiary study has indefinitely allowed me to discover that we do not have all the time in the world when it comes to deadlines, majority of us choose to study online rather then go through books which would supposedly take longer. Instead, we can use user-friendly applications that can allow students to study on the go and have it all accessible on their devices that they use every day. Hence, EZ English or EZ-E is designed for android-based phones and tablets and will be available on apple products very soon. 

EZ English is an application that contains a wide database filled with different languages that a student may choose to learn, whether it may be for a class or during their own personal time outside of school, the program is designed to be effective and efficient whilst keeping the students busy and entertained at the same time. If they are stuck with any problems on the application then they can simply press the help button and all their solutions can be found within the application, this is with the help of the other users who use the same software and can help one another by inputting their questions and answers out there for everyone else to see. 

All the interactive activities in EZ English can be used both online and offline, although majority of the time people or students will be connected to the internet which makes it a much easier process as the time input when choosing an activity to do or language to learn may differ when using the application whilst it is offline. But, there will not be an issue as we slowly improve our software so that it will become silky-smooth to use and have no issues with software or lag input whilst using any of the functions on the application. 
To begin the project, we have to make sure that the sample size that we give the software and application to are from all different types of backgrounds because in this way we can generate feedback and then use that feedback to see whether the translation progress is accurate enough or not, and if it is not then we can use the students correct way of pronouncing the word and integrate it into our current software for future updates. 

Once we have configured the software which we will be doing by utilising Android Software Development Kit and Android Studios we can begin integrating different types of languages onto the Micro SD card which will be our storage system for the device itself. Having two variations of the EZ-E Block will mean that it can store more or less languages, but the prices of the two items will be different, there will be a 128gb version and a 512gb version, each has the exact same use but only that one is more future-proof in terms of how many languages and updates it can store on the device itself. 

All this will hopefully be done before week 10 as stated in the timetable above, because once week 10 is over we should be able to redefine the device and tweak it so that it becomes more than near perfect and stable for future users. Hopefully this will all be achieved by that week, otherwise more time will have to be spent on the product and software, hence the implementation of the new EZ-Ears will have to be delayed and the process for the project idea will have to be extended for a few more weeks. If all goes to plan, then none of this will happen and we will continue with the EZ-Ears introduction during week 12. 

![translation ear piece](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42104341/47611374-ef180800-dab7-11e8-993e-1010ba57ab04.jpg)

Moving onto a Generation of a new item, the EZ-Ears, an in earphone that connects to your phone and is able to translate videos that are played in different languages or voices. The implementation of this new piece of technology is actually because of an idea that I had thought of quite a while ago. The idea was to create an ear piece that could also be integrated into elderly’s hearing aids that can help improve their hearing but at the same time be able to translate on the spot what other people may be saying when they are communicating with random people from another language. The EZ-Ears is not only designed for the elderly but also designed for people who wish to watch other videos that may not be their first language but do not like the use of subtitles and would much prefer direct translation via the ears. In another sense, this is kind of like switching the audio of the video or voice into English or any specified language that you prefer to listen in. 

Trying to implement the hearing aid and language translator on the same hearing device will be quite the challenge but it is not impossible either, with much careful research and careful design of the product, this could rather be useful to many people and could be the next big thing in rising technology. If all goes to plan, we will perfect the EZ-Ears and its software in hopes to advertise it worldwide and showcase it to other companies in hopes to gain an opportunity in partnership, this will be a very big move for Simple Tech and could become the start of something new. 

EZ-E Blocks will be a major implementation into our society and especially for people who travel, we hope that many individuals will seek to use the block as it is designed to help people communicate worldwide with each other and could be deemed as a very useful device for just about anyone who might be afraid of travelling. EZ-Ears may not be as popular as the EZ-E Block but it may be popular for the community of the elderly, especially for those who enjoy socialising and want to be able to understand the people that they talk to without having to talk in a language that they don’t know how to speak in, they can have it directly translated to their ears.

Simple Tech wishes to embark on expanding their business and will continue to do so by continuously updating our products and software, our major goal will always be to help others and making their language learning a much easier and interactive process as our number one goal. Simple Tech will continue to provide for the community and continue to output more interesting devices that are aimed towards the future of our generation. 

**Roles** 

Because I am working alone on this project, I will have to take upon all the roles such as; Lead Developer, Technical Designer and User Interface Designer. It will be quite difficult as I do not have any other peers working with me on this project, but I believe that with hard work and persistency I will be able to pull through and have this project ready by the due date. Working individually on a project would seem rather intense but it is not impossible either. 

**Scopes and Limits** 

![limitations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42104341/47611390-4b7b2780-dab8-11e8-83a8-f3a6df782d69.jpg)

Once we move onto creating devices for translating languages on the spot we can set a scope for the project by only inputting a few languages at a time, a way this can be done is from analysing which countries are visited most and then implementing a full dictionary of those languages into our devices. 

Another limitation worth mentioning is Robots, and how making such a piece of technology could affect people whom are translators, the way this can affect them is by making them lose their jobs because there will not be a need for them anymore if these translating devices do come into play in the future. Although there will be some jobs still remaining such interpreters. Hence this may be a slight limit, but it will definately not limit our capability to continue with the project in the future years.  

**Tools and Technologies** 

Tools or technologies needed to create such a service will be being able to utilise “Android Studio” as it is Google’s officially supported IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for Android applications. Using its emulator and creating a blank template for our service, we will be using “Java” as our source of inputting codes and resource files to generate the output that we will be needing, more specifically ensuring that we have JDK 8 (Java SE Development Kit 8) installed on our PC. This program can be accessed on a relatively fast computer that has high RAM to ensure that our memory is not constrained whilst we are working with our application.

Knowing how to understand Java as it underpins all Android development, understanding of Android SDK (Software Development Kit) and knowing how to use Android Studios will be the main skills required to build such an application. Most of this can be done directly from the computer, and the learning process is not difficult, hence we do not need a lot of knowledge on how to make an application but we do require basic item building which could possibly be done via a 3d printer, we just have to integrate the software onto a device and put it into the printed out EZ-E Block. 

**Testing** 

How we will begin testing the project will be by implementing a sample stack of blocks to schools, and then we will gain feedback based on how well the software had helped them, and if it did not then what were some things that we can improve on so that we can help develop a better more easier to use software. If all goes to plan, then with the EZ-E Blocks we can implement them to tour guides who are travelling overseas, this will be very beneficial to see if this works in real time during their travel period, and like with 
If the project is deemed to be successful upon launch, then m-learning will slowly be incorporated into our daily lives as students and hopefully, in the future, many individuals will find learning a language much simpler and more enjoyable as well. Out with the old and in with the new, we are taking advantage or our current technology to its fullest potential, whilst keeping students of many ages happy and entertained. The same goes with travellers whom have used the items, they will be able to travel stress-free and not having to worry about mispronouncing words or getting to the correct places, all that can now be done with the EZ-E Block. 

**Timeframe** 

![timeline intro to it](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42104341/47255351-6ac3f480-d4bb-11e8-98d6-3f655d029d92.PNG)

**Risks** 

![business risk](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42104341/47611383-2090d380-dab8-11e8-93d2-898bf3df630a.jpg)

Some risks that we may encounter would be that, making a device that is capable of storing such data may come with consequences if there is not enough memory or storage to hold all that information into one small device. Although with technology nowadays, you can have a micro sd card that is capable of holding up to 512GB worth of data in one small card, this is more than plenty to be able to store all the languages avaliable all around the world onto a portable device. Hence this is not so much a risk to Simple Tech as the micro sd card is our main component apart from the EZ-E Block itself where it will be 3D printed and easily assembled to be able to provide an easy and simple device that everyone can use. The EZ-Ears may have a risk of not being able to fit everyones ear correctly, or may have continuous faults or incorrect translations, this can be fixed if we integrate different types of ear bud types that can be swapped on the go depending on the style of your ears, the update situation can be solved via a dock that ear buds plug into when you are not using them, the earbuds can be wired or wireless and all depends on what suits you, either way it will do its job correctly and should not have any problems if we have no troubles with the software development. 

**Group processes and communication** 

Being an ex-member of Group 38, I have ventured out into working by myself into this project due to some communicating issues that I had experienced with my other peers. It is in my best interest that I do this project alone as I have all concentration focused on just myself and not having to worry about anyone else but the project and getting it done on time. Talking about my ex-group, the ways that we had sometimes communicated was via email and WhatsApp as majority of the members did not have Facebook, hence we had to do it a different way in which everyone was able to communicate with each other, but not long after that barely any communication was made. Usually you would expect contact outside of class time, but my group members did not go to the tutorials or lectures, so it made it very hard for me to communicate with them, therefore working alone has allowed me to work at a much faster pace and be more effective and efficient at the same time.

# Feedback: 

100% Contribution for myself as I worked solo on this assignment. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Group Reflection: 

Because I did not have a group in this assignment, I can not say too much about the group reflection itself apart from the fact that it definately would have been better if my group from Assignment 2 had the same commitment levels as me and were able to communicate to me more regularly. Although I can safely say that from my past experience with groups, they have always been a positive one, being in a group allows you to gather thoughts of not just from your head, but from everyone else's and it's a very surprising thing sometimes because you never know who you share common thoughts with and that could generally end up being very useful for ideas when writing a report or doing a group presentation. Group work is definately time consuming, but with the right people, it could indefinitely make things a lot easier.
